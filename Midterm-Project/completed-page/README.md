# Midterm Project - Final Page

This site uses the BEM methodology, which utilizes Blocks, Elements and Modifiers. In essence, class names are designed to have clear meaning that explains and defines the purpose of each item on the page, rather than arbitrary names without any inherent meaning.

The class names here generally consist of a block/item on the page (article), then an element to define the type of content (article-item or article-link). Each visibly divided page is defined with section tags and classes (section-1 through 5). Semantic HTML markup (< footer >, < nav >, etc) is also used where applicable.

CSS is organized in order of appearance on the page. Items within section-# classes are nested within the main .section-# styling.
