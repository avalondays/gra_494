                <h2>About Our Institute</h2>
                <p>As one of the founding members of the American Cybernetics Association in 1998, the Goddard Institute
                    of Cybernetics prides itself on putting compassion at the forefront of every technological endeavor.
                    Our programs and grants have given thousands of individuals a second chance at life, providing
                    life-saving cybernetic enhancements, prosthetics, and more. Research sourced from Goddard has
                    reached as far as the UN, changing the course of bionics forever. We host a number of tours,
                    workshops, rehab programs, and student opportunities every year.</p>

                <h2>Employee Highlight: Adya</h2>
                <p>"Since officially retiring from agent work, I've also been promoted to a position where I finally
                    have an office! It's certainly something to get used to. Since my work generally consists of meeting
                    with civilians and discussing their experiences, I've tried to make it a welcoming space-- less of
                    an
                    <i>office</i> office and more of a space for simple conversation. I like to play those long,
                    continuous playlists of lo-fi music with the cute video loops, especially when I speak to kids. They
                    really seem to enjoy it!"
